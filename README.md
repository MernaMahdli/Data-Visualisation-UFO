# Data-Visualisation-UFO

Software Used: Power BI
Date: July 2021

Story Time:

My First Data Visualisation, done for a Google Developer's Group - Cairo Boot camp, in 2021.

The instructor gave us the freedom of picking any dataset we thought would be interesting, and a 1-week time limit to complete simple data cleaning and visualisation.

I have included the .pbix file and some images for easier access to the completed dashboard
